    <h3>Salsa is Life</h3>
    <p>Fresh tomato salsa is ideally made with firm, fleshy tomatoes. You can of course make the salsa with any kind of tomato, but the firm ones like Romas or hothouse tomatoes will hold up the best.</p>
    <p>When using fresh chili peppers always taste first before adding! Some peppers are hotter than others and you really can't tell unless you taste them. Just take a very small taste. You'll be able to gauge the heat of the pepper and will be better able to judge how much you need.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 medium fresh tomatoes (1 to 1 1/2 pounds), stems removed</li>
        <li>2 serrano or 1 jalapeño pepper, stems, ribs, and seeds removed (less or more to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cumin, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop the tomatoes, chili peppers, and onions. Be careful while handling the chili peppers. Use a plastic baggie or disposable gloves to handle them, or wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after handling and avoid touching your eyes for several hours. Set aside some of the seeds from the peppers. If the salsa isn't hot enough, you can add a few for more heat.</li>
        <li>Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade. Pulse only a few times, just enough to finely dice the ingredients and not enough to purée. If you don't have a food processor, you can finely dice by hand.</li>
        <li>Place in a serving bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the chilis make the salsa too hot, add some more chopped tomato. If it's not hot enough, carefully add a few of the seeds from the chilis, or add a little more ground cumin.</li>
    </ol>

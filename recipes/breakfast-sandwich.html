    <h3>A Good Morning Breaky Sammy</h3>
    <p>The essential is obviously the soft scramble, which we talked about at length earlier this week. This is no McDs breakfast sandwich (although, to be fair, I have been known to eat and love a Sausage Biscuit with Egg in moments of weakness). But no, there are no perfectly formed egg disk here.</p>
    <p>A delicious simple arugula or mixed greens salad with vinaigrette would be great here. Also: fruit, juice and/or mimosas, pastries of some kind, and (obviously) lots of coffee.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 fresh bagel</li>
        <li>1 or 2 farm fresh eggs</li>
        <li>Sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Siracha Mayo</li>
        <li>1 handful of baby spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast Bagel while you heat the frying pan</li>
        <li>Fry egg/s to over-easy</li>
        <li>Add a slice of cheese and mayo to toasted bagel</li>
        <li>When eggs are ready, slide on to the bagel</li>
        <li>Pile high with spinach</li>
    </ol>
